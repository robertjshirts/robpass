## What Works

### Core Authentication
- User registration with secure key derivation
- Login with authentication hash verification
- Session token generation and validation
- Rate limiting and security logging

### TOTP Implementation
- TOTP secret generation from master key
- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- TOTP code generation and verification
- Backup code generation and verification
- Encrypted storage of TOTP secrets
- Complete API endpoints for TOTP operations

### Vault Operations
- Encrypted credential storage and retrieval
- Client-side encryption/decryption
- Vault item management (CRUD operations)

### Security Architecture
- Zero-knowledge design maintained
- All sensitive operations performed client-side
- Proper encryption key management
- Security event logging

## What's Left to Build

### UI Integration
- Connect TOTP modals to main application
- Add TOTP settings to user dashboard
- Update login flow to handle TOTP requirements

### Enhanced Features
- Session management improvements
- Advanced security features
- User experience enhancements

### Testing & Deployment
- Comprehensive test suite
- Production deployment configuration
- Documentation and user guides

## Known Issues
- TOTP components created but not yet integrated into main app flow
- Need to update existing login form to handle TOTP verification
- Database migration needed for TOTP fields

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### TOTP Implementation Approach
- **Decision**: Implement TOTP with client-side verification
- **Rationale**: Maintains zero-knowledge architecture by deriving TOTP secret from master key
- **Implementation**: TOTP secret derived using HKDF, encrypted with master key for storage

### Backup Code Strategy
- **Decision**: Generate cryptographically secure backup codes
- **Rationale**: Provides recovery mechanism while maintaining security
- **Implementation**: Codes hashed before storage, single-use verification

### QR Code Generation
- **Decision**: Generate QR codes server-side for TOTP setup
- **Rationale**: Simplifies client implementation while maintaining security
- **Implementation**: Uses qrcode library with proper error correction

### Database Schema Updates
- **Decision**: Add TOTP fields to existing users table
- **Rationale**: Keeps user authentication data centralized
- **Implementation**: Added totp_enabled, totp_secret_encrypted, totp_secret_iv fields

## Technical Achievements

### TOTP Library (`src/lib/totp.ts`)
- RFC 6238 compliant implementation
- HKDF-based secret derivation
- Base32 encoding/decoding
- Constant-time comparison for security
- QR code generation with proper formatting

### API Endpoints
- `/api/auth/totp/enable` - Enable TOTP for user
- `/api/auth/totp/disable` - Disable TOTP for user
- `/api/auth/totp/status` - Check TOTP status
- `/api/auth/totp/verify-login` - Complete login with TOTP
- `/api/auth/totp/recover` - Login with backup code

### React Components
- `TotpSetupModal` - Complete TOTP setup flow
- `TotpLoginModal` - TOTP verification during login
- `BackupCodeModal` - Backup code recovery interface

### Security Considerations
- TOTP secrets encrypted with user's master key
- Backup codes hashed before storage
- Rate limiting on authentication attempts
- Proper session management
- Security event logging for all TOTP operations
