-   No automated test suite is currently present.

## What's Left to Build
## What's Left to Build
-   Further detailed analysis of existing codebase beyond `README.md`.
-   Implementation of all features outlined in `productContext.md`.
-   Define and implement a new testing strategy (no automated tests currently present).
-   Deployment strategy.

## Known Issues
