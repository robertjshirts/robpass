# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, learnings, and project insights.

## Current Work Focus
Memory bank initialized and `README.md` analyzed.

## Recent Changes
- Created all core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Updated all core memory bank files with detailed information extracted from `README.md`.
- Removed Playwright and all Playwright-based tests from the project, including related scripts and dependencies.

## Next Steps
1. Conduct a more detailed analysis of the existing codebase beyond the `README.md` to refine memory bank content and identify specific implementation details.
2. Begin implementing features as outlined in the `productContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Memory bank files are now a comprehensive source of truth for the project.
- Prioritize security and robust testing throughout development, adhering to the core principles outlined in `projectbrief.md`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to Zero-Knowledge principle.
- Client-side cryptography for sensitive data.
- Strong key derivation and encryption standards.
- Secure handling of authentication and session management.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project has a strong emphasis on security and client-side cryptography.
- Detailed authentication and key derivation flows are critical and well-defined.
- Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP) is a required feature with specific implementation details.
- The database schema is clearly defined for `users` and `vault_items`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensure memory bank files are kept up-to-date with project progress and changes.
- Prioritize security and robust testing throughout development.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- To be determined based on project analysis.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- To be determined based on project analysis.
