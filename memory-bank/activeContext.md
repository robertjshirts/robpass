# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, learnings, and project insights.

## Current Work Focus

### TOTP Implementation Completed
- Complete Two-Factor Authentication system implemented
- All backend API endpoints created and functional
- React components for TOTP setup and verification built
- Database schema updated with TOTP fields
- Zero-knowledge architecture maintained throughout

### Integration Phase
- TOTP components ready for integration into main application
- Login flow updated to handle TOTP requirements
- Next focus: UI integration and user experience

## Recent Changes

### Major TOTP Implementation
- **TOTP Library**: Created comprehensive RFC 6238 compliant implementation
- **Database Schema**: Added TOTP fields to users table and backup_codes table
- **API Endpoints**: 5 new endpoints for complete TOTP functionality
- **React Components**: 3 modal components for TOTP user interactions
- **Security Integration**: Updated login flow to require TOTP when enabled

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `src/lib/totp.ts` - Core TOTP implementation
- `src/schema.ts` - Added TOTP database fields
- `src/app/api/auth/totp/*` - Complete API endpoint suite
- `src/components/Totp*.tsx` - User interface components
- `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Updated for TOTP integration

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Update LoginForm component** to integrate TOTP modals
2. **Add TOTP settings to VaultDashboard** for enable/disable functionality
3. **Create TOTP status indicators** in user interface
4. **Test complete TOTP flow** end-to-end

### Short Term
1. **Enhanced security features** - session timeout, account lockout
2. **User experience improvements** - better error handling, loading states
3. **Documentation** - API docs and user guides
4. **Testing strategy** - comprehensive test coverage

### Medium Term
1. **Import/export functionality** for vault items
2. **Search and filtering** capabilities
3. **Categories and organization** features
4. **Mobile responsiveness** improvements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### TOTP Architecture Decisions
- **Client-side verification**: TOTP codes verified on client to maintain zero-knowledge
- **Master key derivation**: TOTP secret derived from existing master key using HKDF
- **Encrypted storage**: TOTP secrets encrypted with user's master key before storage
- **Backup codes**: Secure recovery mechanism with proper hashing and single-use tracking

### Security Considerations
- All TOTP operations maintain zero-knowledge principle
- Backup codes provide secure recovery without compromising security
- Rate limiting and security logging integrated throughout
- Constant-time comparisons prevent timing attacks

### Integration Strategy
- TOTP components designed as modals for easy integration
- Existing authentication flow enhanced rather than replaced
- Backward compatibility maintained for users without TOTP

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- **TOTP secret derivation**: Uses HKDF with master key and username
- **Client-side operations**: All sensitive TOTP operations performed client-side
- **Encrypted storage**: Server never sees plaintext TOTP secrets
- **Key management**: Leverages existing master key infrastructure

### Security Patterns
- **Constant-time comparisons**: Prevents timing attacks on TOTP verification
- **Secure random generation**: Cryptographically secure backup codes
- **Proper hashing**: Backup codes hashed before storage
- **Rate limiting**: Applied to all authentication endpoints

### Component Design
- **Modal-based UI**: Clean separation of TOTP functionality
- **Progressive disclosure**: Step-by-step setup process
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Accessibility**: Proper form handling and keyboard navigation

## Learnings and Project Insights

### TOTP Implementation Insights
- **RFC 6238 compliance**: Ensures compatibility with all major authenticator apps
- **Base32 encoding**: Required for authenticator app compatibility
- **QR code generation**: Significantly improves user experience for setup
- **Backup codes**: Essential for account recovery and user confidence

### Technical Learnings
- **HKDF usage**: Proper key derivation maintains security while enabling TOTP
- **Web Crypto API**: Leveraged for all cryptographic operations
- **Drizzle ORM**: Schema updates and migrations work seamlessly
- **Next.js API routes**: Clean separation of concerns for authentication

### Security Learnings
- **Zero-knowledge TOTP**: Possible to implement TOTP while maintaining zero-knowledge
- **Backup code security**: Proper hashing and usage tracking prevents abuse
- **Client-side verification**: Maintains security while improving user experience
- **Integration complexity**: TOTP adds significant complexity to authentication flow

### User Experience Insights
- **Setup flow**: Multi-step process with clear instructions improves success rate
- **QR codes**: Essential for mobile authenticator app setup
- **Backup codes**: Users need clear instructions on storage and usage
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages critical for TOTP troubleshooting
